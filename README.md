## About the Project
Many tourist spots in Recife can become extremely hot, discouraging visitors and impacting the local economy. **ClimatizaRec** aims to solve this problem by monitoring environmental conditions like temperature and humidity, and by detecting the presence of people. Based on the collected data, we will propose ways to make the environment more comfortable and attractive for tourists.

Currently, we simulate temperature, humidity, and presence changes using potentiometers. In the future, the presence of people will be detected through computer vision techniques.

## Hardware Used
- **ESP32** microcontroller
- **DHT11** sensor (for temperature and humidity)
- **Three potentiometers** (to simulate changes in temperature, humidity, and presence)

## Future Improvements
- Implement computer vision to accurately detect the presence of people.
- Expand data collection with more environmental sensors.
- Develop a dashboard for real-time monitoring and control.
